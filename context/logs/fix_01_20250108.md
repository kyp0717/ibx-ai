# Fix 01: Order Cancellation Handling
**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Status**: Completed

## Issue
Interactive prompt stopped working after manually cancelling an order in TWS. The buy prompt would not allow placing another order after cancellation.

## Root Cause
The order_placed flag remained True after order cancellation, preventing re-entry into the buy order prompt logic.

## Solution
- Reset order_placed flag to False when buy order is cancelled
- Display informative message about retry capability
- Handle sell order cancellation similarly
- Ensure monitor_order returns updated order status
