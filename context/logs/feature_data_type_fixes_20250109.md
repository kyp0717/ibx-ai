# Feature: Data Type Compatibility Fixes

## Date: 2025-01-09
## Component: Technical Indicators
## File: src/technical_indicators.py

### Issue 1: Deque Slice Operations
**Problem Discovered**:
- Deque objects don't support slice notation like lists
- TypeError: "sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'"
- Occurred in historicalDataEnd when trying to process bars[:-1]

**Impact**:
- EMA initialization failed
- Could not process historical bars for indicator calculation
- Application crashed during startup

**Solution**:
- Convert deque to list before slicing: bars_list = list(self.bars_10sec)
- Applied to both 10-second and 30-second bar processing
- Lines 171-177 and 187-193

### Issue 2: Decimal Volume Type
**Problem Discovered**:
- TWS API returns volume as decimal.Decimal type
- TypeError: "unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'decimal.Decimal'"
- Occurred during VWAP calculation (typical_price * volume)

**Impact**:
- VWAP calculation failed completely
- Indicators panel could not display VWAP values
- Thread crash in historicalDataEnd method

**Solution**:
- Convert Decimal to int at data ingestion: volume=int(bar.volume) - Line 124
- Convert to float during VWAP calculation: volume = float(bar.volume) - Line 274
- Maintains compatibility with both Decimal and integer volume types

### Testing Completed
- 8 tests for deque slice operations
- 9 tests for Decimal volume handling
- All tests passing with proper type conversions
- Edge cases validated (empty deques, zero volumes)

### Key Learnings
- Python collections.deque is optimized for append/pop but lacks slice support
- TWS API may return different numeric types (Decimal vs int/float)
- Type conversion strategy must maintain calculation accuracy
- Always validate data types when interfacing with external APIs
